The bar and restaurant are expensive so it is best to go elsewhere in the neighbourhood or into the centre of Paris. The metro is close by and the Champs D'Elyesee is about 20 minutes away.

Upon check in, the room that was allocated to us was filled with stale smoke, despite asking repeatedly for a non-smoking room. This was quickly and professionally dealt with by the front desk, but then, to our dismay, we were moved to a pokey little room at the end of a corridor, about half the size of the first room! We did not bother complaining again, and stayed put. Note to self: New Year's resolution: Take up smoking.The next dissapointment was the breakfast, which was a pretty basic affair, even for Paris, and cooked incredibly poorly. The baked beans were boiled so much each day, that all flavour had been methodically extracted from each bean leaving them bland and indedible, and the scrambled eggs were a cheap floury cheap mess - not even the orange juice could escape the quest for improving the bottom line, as this was severely watered down.Again, not what I would expect from a Raddisson or a 4* hotel.The last point that was slightly annoying was that no internet connection had been arranged for our room, and every day, I was forced to use a temporary account linked to another guest and his room. It solved the problem of course, but left me with the impression that I wasn't a valued visitor of the hotel as they couldn't be bothered finding a long term solution.Lastly, in relation to the location, it's not bad (a metro station is available two minutes away, over the bridge), but as one reviewer points out, it is a little too far to go if using it as a base to explore Paris. All in all, I would say that this Radisson falls behind the standards of many of the others in the chain. I could go on about its many other annoyances: Charged 20 Euros for alledged mini bar usage (didn't open the fridge once) - Charged 16 Euros for three two minute calls made internally in Paris - Felt the rumbling of the Metro at night underneath us, which could wake light sleepers etcBut not having paid top dollar, these things didn't annoy us as much as they would have done ordinarily.In conclusion then, I would not recommend staying here if you are looking for luxury, 4* star standard or convenience, but only if you can secure an absolute bargain!

Loved our stay! My boyfriend took me to Paris for our anniversary for four days. The hotel we stayed in was absolutely gorgeous, and it was by far better than I had imagined. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by 4 members of staff, who were very kind and helpful during all of our stay. They speak really good english, which really helped! There was a beautiful lounge, with a mezzanine of the first floor of which were hotel rooms which we stayed in. It was a luxury design! I was very impressed with the hotel room just as I was with the hotel in general, and I have taken photographs so please take a look! The room has a very modern feel to it, and there was also a wall fitted flat screen TV! There aren't much english channels to watch, but there are a few american channels, and BBC 1 and 2. There are movies which you can watch but you have to pay. Of course, we didn't come to watch TV! But during one of the late nights me and my boyfriend watched The Pursuit Of Happiness and Stomp The Yard which were about 7 EUR each, but we enjoyed both movies greatly. Very quiet during our stay too, and it wasn't so busy. Nothing bothered us during the nights.. we always slept until midday because I guess we were so comfortable! They gave us room service everyday of our stay, even though we didn't really require it that often, which I found really sweet. They changed all our towels everyday, and even our bed sheets! So everyday we came home to a brand new room! What more can you ask for? Other information:The travel adapter we brought was wrong, so don't worry, you can rent one there for 5 EUR, which you can get back at the end of your stay. There is also free broadband internet access there for business customers. The safe was also very high tech and safe too. There is free coffee and tea in the mini bar which we managed to finish on the second night! The restaurant looked interesting too, but the price list wasn't too impressive. There are so many restaurants just opposite the road of the hotel, which was more filling than anything! Paris:Overall, travel was by far more convenient than London. The french must hate walking, since the stops are so close to each other. But BEWARE, the tube map is so complexed! Porte de St Cloud is the nearest station to the hotel, and getting to places like the Tour Eiffel, Galeries Lafayette was easy and fairly quick... in fact everywhere was pretty convenient as the stops went really quickly. If in doubt, just take a taxi because they are also quite cheap! People in paris don't really speak english. Well, they do, but they are too lazy to talk to you in english, they like to prefer to answer to you in french. Especially in restaurants. It was fairly cold when we went to Paris, but we very much enjoyed our stay and the atmosphere there. We also went to disneyland on the last day also which was really fun! I really recommend this hotel for anyone who is planning on visiting Paris, as you will find it will really add comfort to your stay.There are other branches of this hotel, I believe one in centre of Paris too. I hope this review has helped you into finding a hotel for your stay, please feel free to email me for any other questions you may have! Hope you have fun!

On arrival I was suprised to find the Hotel is brand new (only 1or 2 years old), it is very modern looking and spotlessly clean. I stayed in a Twin Room which again was spotless with everything you needed - Bed, Shower, Kettle, Sat TV (which included BBC1  2 as well as Sky News) and a Safe Deposit Box. The room size was adequate although I have stayed in smaller.Breakfast was 22 euros (拢16) which is quite steep although you can't fault the selection - Cereals, Fruit, Juice, Tea, Coffee, Toast, Yoghurt, Salmon, Cheese and of course the Full English but be warned the Sausage and Bacon are not what you would get back home in blighty and if I am honest not very nice. However, you must try the Croissants which are the best I have ever tasted. The Hotel boasts a Fitness Room (which I never used), but looked very impressive and a lounge area where you could relax and read the papers although DONT buy a beer there 拢15 Euros for a pint - Thats 拢11.There is a metro station is around 300mts away and its only 15mins to the centre of Paris.There are also some nice little restaurants along this street and not very expensive.The Staff are excellent and speak very good English. I would certainly recommend the Hotel to stay at - But beware the sausages !!!!!

I am a very light sleeper when away from home and can normally hear pins dropping two floors up but found the room sound insulation to be very good and heard nothing from the adjoining rooms. However there is a faint rumble of Metro to be heard (even from the 4th floor) but nothing to complain about.There is minimal nightlife as this is a decent residential area although there are still a few half decent restaurants and a bar nearby. The drinks at the hotel bar are ludicrous, e.g. 15 euros for a 50cc beer, that's about 拢10 a pint for UK people. Don't drink there.I did not dine in the evenings at the hotel but the breakfast was not bad, with a large selection of just about anything you could think of. However, the French have never been able to do sausage, bacon and baked beans like the English. I was B  B but I think 22 euros for breakfast would have been a little on the steep side but I've seen worse.There is a Metro terminus about 300 yards away and it only takes about 15 minutes into the city centre.The room size was adequate rather than spacious but on the whole very highly recommended.
