They have a nice courtyard in the middle of the hotel and what seemed to be a nice pool (it was a way to cold for us to try out!) Our room had a newer digital heater/air conditioner that worked great. This wasn't a 5 star but for a family on a budget it was great.

Won't be staying here again. I had a mixed reaction with the front desk personnel. An old woman at the desk was quite abrupt and rude. A male receptionist I spoke with was very nice though. I woke up the last day with bed bug bites, so beware of bed bugs. The room was very average. As another reviewer pointed out, the front lobby is gorgeous but very misleading in terms of first impressions. Your room will definitely be plain. My room's door did not even completely fit the door slot, so there was enough room for a cold draft to get in during the night, as well as the noises of cars, people, and airplanes. The glass windows were not the kind you could open. There was a good air conditioning/heating unit underneath the window with the ability to automatically control the temperature to the degree. There was a work desk, two chairs, and a small circular table. Not really much in terms of tv programming; don't expect a LCD tv. They charge for wi-fi service. I did bring my laptop but chose not to use it so I can't really comment on its quality. The shuttle service serves four local motels including Good Nite Inn. It supposedly runs every 30 or so minutes from 4am until past midnight. There were times when the shuttle seemed to take far longer than 30 minutes, so be patient. Other airport shuttles seemed to be much more consistent and come more often, but maybe it was my imagination. It drops off at the international terminal, domestic terminal, and BART (Bay Area Rapid Transport), which is your high-speed rail gateway to downtown San Francisco. I highly recommend BART if staying at an airport-area hotel. The Chinese Beijing Buffet on the hotel's site was absolutely disgusting. I was set back a small fortune (including being charged separately for a drink). I had to deal with poor service (I had to wait about 20-30 minutes after I was seated to be served my first drink and then I had to chase down another waiter for a straw). There were pretty much all young people with bad attitudes employed there. I also found a hair amongst some of the chicken I got. I could not finish my dinner and I might as well have flushed the money down the toilet. But there really is not much in terms of restaurants. However, there are other restaurants at the nearby Holiday Inn and Four Points by Sheraton. There also is an IHOP and Wendy's a short walk away, as well as a Food Mart at a gas station. One note: if you choose to go to San Francisco, please remember that BART operates only during select hours (i.e. from about 4am-12am on weekdays, but only 6am-12am on Sat and 8am-12am on Sun). Also, most of the big museums I wanted to visit were closed on Mondays, much to my disappointment (Legion of Honor, De Young, Asian Art Museum). So do your research beforehand carefully as I had pretty much nothing to do on that Monday except go to the Golden Gate Bridge.

No, no one had any idea where it was, or seemed to be capable of looking for it. The lady finally explained that the shuttle was run by a separate company, not the hotel, and she didn't know if they had it or not. No one could help me.When we got on the shuttle to the hotel ourselves, I FINALLY got a number from the driver himself, to reach the shuttle company. The next day after repeatedly calling them, they confirmed that they did, indeed, have my bag in their lost-and-found. (How come nobody else was able to call this number for me a week earlier?) He promised to get it to the hotel.So, eventually when I reached someone at the hotel, they confirmed that it was there (wonderful!). But no, they wouldn't pay to send it to me. I was going to have to pay the shipping to get back the bag that I COULD have picked up easily if only someone had made one simple phone call to the shuttle company!So hey, if you stay there, you'll probably find the hotel is clean and comfortable.

We made a complaint at 8am and returned to our room at 8pm and it still was not fixed, they sent their maintenence guy to our room at 9pm to work on our toilet and was told they could not move our room because it was already cleaned and we messed up the bed. All this as well as no sleep either of the 2 nights, this is a drug dealers hang out!! ....................vacationers BEWARE!!!

Expedia threw up this hotel and it delivered exactly as it promised.It's easy to find from SFO if you're driving but there's a complementary shuttle which picks up every half hour from the airport. The transfer only takes a few minutes. It's quite a large complex and if you get a far room and have a lot of luggage, the walk can become quite a hike I think. Check-in was efficient and unfortuantely, I just missed the Chinese buffet restaurant within the hotel.The room was clean and was competently decorated. The only downside was the thinness of the pillows - ended up sleeping on all of them to get comfortable.A nice bonus for a hotel of this price was complimentary use of a computer which was handy for checking in for my flight on-line. I wasn't able to partake of their other services - complementary continental breakfast and outdoor swimming pool.Check-out was efficient and the shuttle delivered me back to the airport for my flight.

It's a former Ramada and has a pool and breakfast (cereal, toast, peanut butter and jelly). The rooms aren't highly impressive, but it's a decent and clean enough place to sleep for the night after spending a day in SF. We stayed in an interior room facing the garden area, it was a pretty nice view. We've stayed in SF many times, and we never spend much time in our hotel room, so it didn't make much of a difference to us when we had to drive a little further to get here.

Good Nite Inn was absolutely fine for this purpose. However, we could hear the planes and our neighbour's shower pipes at 5.30am (we were awake due to jet lag! ) so I probably wouldn't recommend it for more than 1 night unless you don't mind a bit of noise. Our room was large and in good condition and had a powerful shower.

They told my party and I to sit down for a while. After about 15 to 20 minutes of waiting... People coming and going... Which I did not understand. I went up to ask the two ladies up front AGAIN and said, What is going on? And I was finally told, which they DID NOT tell me honestly in the first place, that their computers were down and they could not process my reservation YET! Since my party and I was not aware of that, we were pretty pissed off... We had two more persons waiting in the car. I demanded that they give me two rooms right away or a refund. I had a schedule to go by and a place I had to be at and if they can't do that for me then they better tell me something better... the Manager was there but all they could assure me was that... they were trying their best. Of course I can understand that this kind of problem could happen. What I didn't understand was, what kind of hotel is this when they don't even have a backup plan. I'm not doubting that this cannot happen again... They explained to me because the computers were down, the cards they gave us were useless. I waited about 10 more minutes or so for the this guy to come and open both of the hotel rooms I reserved and he open them with keys.... I was told by the ladies up front that maybe within 30 minutes to an hour that this would be fixed... When we were all inside, on of the hotel room had no hot water.... how were we all suppose to get ready in time.... and really there was no time for us because of the waiting down in the lobby. We had no keys, no hot water.... Because of this big problem my party and I were late to the banquet we all had to attend and was not abel to enter. Anyone in our situation of course would be totally pissed off.... AND WE WERE... When we got back to the hotel... we had to go back to the front and was told that it was not working yet... but the hot water was. So here we go again, walking back to the our hotel rooms waiting for someone to open the door AGAIN!... Can you imagine how irritating that was... anyone would...! The next morning... I wanted to get some batteries and I got them but my credit card got stuck in the machine... When I went and told the lady up front in the lobby... it seemed as thought she did not understand a word I said... after explaining about four times... she understood... I did get may card back... but I thought a whole weekend full of problems... and all of them was with this hotel... We finally got the cards to work by saturday night... and when we needed some more tissues in the bath room for both rooms... it took them 30 minutes and two calls just to give it to us... Overall stay was just okay but above all else... it was horrible, of course we all felt like we should get out money back or at least half of it to be fair... I hope that I never come back to this hotel. It was nothing I imagined it to be....... And to rate this hotel from 1 to 5 stars... I'd say one star... I hope that no one ever goes through this... and that would save you so much disappointments...
