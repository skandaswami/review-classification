It's best for travelers who like to stay in little inns, guest houses, motels, and nicer hostels and who seek out a fun adventure (rather than travelers who seek the consistency of moderate to pricey chain hotels). For what it is, Venice on the Beach is definitely a #4, which is why I ranked it as such, but I myself was surprised when I drove up to it because the reviews on TripAdvisor made it sound like it was a different kind of establishment. Instead it's very down home with some nice features. Just for context, I am a female business traveler who travels frequently and solo. While I usually stay in mid-range business hotel chains (Hyatt, Hilton group, Starwood group, etc.), , in my personal travel I like high-end hotels and resorts as well as artsy, cool little places off the beaten path.The really positive things about Venice on the Beach: great location right on the beach, warm and friendly staff, laid back and independent feel, good wireless, comfortable bed and pillows, soft, fresh white linens, rooms conveniently appointed, two great outdoor public areas to hang out which look directly out onto the beautiful beach where many people are jogging, walking their dogs, and enjoying the beach. Despite the action, it is relatively quiet.Less appealing things about it: The feel is definitely that of an older motel that has a fresh coat of paint (without having stripped the old paint first) and new windows and bathroom fixtures. There was some nice effort made, but the finishes and workmanship are a bit rough. As a solo female traveler, I would not have felt comfortable walking around the area at night, but I had a car. There are a few parking spaces in front of the building that are first come, first served. I didn't have trouble parking when I returned after dinner, but reportedly it is harder to find parking in the winter. I don't know what I would have done if all the parking spots were taken as street parking is very restricted around that area.My room was small but had a big window looking directly out on the beach (which I paid extra for but was worth it). The window had pretty white wood shutters. The bed was comfortable with fresh white cotton linens. The rest of the furniture (desk, nightstand) was white laminate that was peeling or stained in some areas. There was a small fridge and microwave in the room. Ceramic tile floor, small bathroom with new fixtures and a ceramic tile shower. Generally clean but because the redecorating was done roughly, the overall feeling is new finishes in a worn context. On the other hand, I fell asleep and woke up to the sound of the ocean right outside my window. Although I heard other guests when they were in public areas, my night itself was quiet and peaceful. I did not eat the continental breakfast in the morning, but there are packaged pastries, coffee, and tea set out. The staff was welcoming, accommodating, and warm. Well located for beach, restaurants, major highways, Venice, Santa Monica, and Marina del Rey. If you have a few extra hours, drive up to Malibu beaches along the coast.

The front and rear doors of the hotels are locked in the evenings for the guests security. I rang the bell but there was no one there to let me in. I called Matthew and he told me how I could get into the building without a key. Since I didn't see Matthew until my last day there, I wasn't able to get a key and I had to break in to the hotel every night. You would be amazed how easy it was to get in late at night without a key.The room was the smallest and one of the worst hotel rooms I had ever seen. The room was never cleaned while I was there.On the morning of the day I was leaving, they were painting the trim on the building on the area were their parking is. There was quite a few white spots on my red rental car. Fortunately, the rental agency either didn't notice or didn't care.This hotel is in a great location but, unless you don't care about the quality of where you stay and like the uncertainty of a less than secure hotel, than find somewhere else to stay.

Cozy and adorable, it is the perfect place for short or long-term stays. Nestled right between Marina Del Rey and Santa Monica, the hotel is fresh and fun and full of interesting wayfayers who are easy to chat with in the open beachfront setting. Right outside, Ocean Front Walk beckons with easy beach access, nearby restaurants and great people watching. The hotel -- always cheery, clean and very capably managed -- never fails me. I always feel relaxed and happy when there to get my beach fix and to mix it up with all the glamour of LA.

A clean, comfortable and spacious place to stay that was reasonably priced. If you are looking for a place to stay that is right in front of the beach this is the place to be. Luckily, this hotel had nice guests during my visit (except a guy named Nelson) and our room had a kitchen, bathroom, and a plasma TV in the living room and bedroom. There was also a washer and dryer in the hotel which was fantastic b/c I could wash my dirty clothes when I came home鈥攁nd sometimes I wanted to wear something twice so I was able to wash it there. It felt like I had never left home! It was wonderful. Every afternoon the maid came in and organized our room after we left. Thus, the entire time we were able to relax without being disturbed by the maid, b/c we had put the sign on our door (good thing to remember to do when coming in the wee hours of the morning- We had left the door sign out not to disturb us while we were there, in the mornings, and put the sign out to tidy our room when we went out in the afternoon, so the room was ready when we came back.). Therefore, the maid and the manager were very helpful.So, basically my advice is: if you are not a caveman/woman and can appreciate the finer things in life and want a nice, relaxing place to go, the definitely stay here. Venice on the Beach Hotel rocks!

My newly renovated room had an ocean view room to die for. I receiveed excellent service from the manager Matthew and the maid Anna.I have a return reservation for the month of July.

My trip to L.A. was nice, but my hotel stay was a nightmare. Everything you hope a hotel NOT to be, Venice on the Beach was. The manager is obviously doing drugs and is incoherent to requests. I simply did NOT have my room cleaned the entire stay (4 nights), in which I had to retrieve the code from the manager (who was never there) to get my own blankets, sheets, towels, toilet paper, etc. Not only that, what happened to the complementary wine at sunset? And as far as noise goes, than god I brought ear plugs. So, after spilling my complaints politely to the manager, he told me he would refund $100 back to my card, in which he has never done. I have to contact him each time he says he will get back to me. It has been 3 weeks since I have stayed there.I would advise you to even stay at a cheap motel over this place because Venice On the Beach is not anywhere even near motel quality.

It took several hours to check into one of our rooms.*Very limited parking - there were ~18 rooms but only about 6 parking spots.* Cleaning services poor - the dishwahser in the suite was full of dirty dished from the previous occupant, trashcans were not emptied daily, and the bathrooms were not very clean.* Bad soundproofing in the roomsGood or bad depending on your perspective:* They accept dogs ", "Author": "swelch", "BusinessServiceRating": 0, "RoomsRating": 3}, {"ValueRating": 5, "Helpfullness": 0, "Reader": 0, "ServiceRating": 5, "OverallRating": 5, "ReceptionRating": 5, "LocationRating": 5, "Date": "Jan 22, 2007", "CleanlinessRating": 5, "Content": "loved the staff and location we saw this hotel as we walked on the beach, we booked in and stayed for a week, we loved it clean modern, and frirendly helpful management this was the 3rd hotel we stayed in in los angeles , it was the cheapest and the best value for money,we jumped on the local buses everywhere walked or hired bikes the manager janie walsh was brilliant and even ran us to the airport when we missed the shuttle. 5****** rating for everything and i have stayed in 5* hotels .The local is great for every age group and we will stay again soon all our needs were met.
