Good location, Modern comfort. This hotel was a real find. We spent 4 nights here in June. A great location on Paral.lel... 7-8 minute walk from La Rambla, 3 minute walk from nearest subway station (Diagonal) and the funicular that whisks you up to Montjuic, 10 minute walk from the port area where the seaside shopping complex is. A lot of tourists prefer to stay in the middle of action right on La Rambla or in and around the Old City, but I personally prefer this hotel's location since the area's not quite as hectic. The rooms are more modern and cleaner and the service is much more professional than what I expected of a 3-star Spanish hotel. The front desk staff is helpful and efficient and all speak English well. The guestroom was very clean; maybe it was recently renovated. The bathroom had a very modern design, with glass shower door. The housekeeping was generous in replenishing toiletries (which were of pretty good quality) and towels everyday... not something you can count on at every 3-star hotel in mediterranean Europe. Beds were not that comfortable, but not too horrible either.Back to the location issue... if you take the straight path from the hotel to La Ramble, you'd be walking through a bit of a rough area of Barcelona. If you're a woman, my best advice is to be mindful of your belongings during the day and to avoid walking there alone altogether at night.We would definitely stay here again if the price is right.

Positives:- Hotel is relatively clean and new- Hotel staff are courteous and as helpful as they can be (some know english a little better than the others but I give them all points for effort).-Breakfast is fine (never crowded, that's for sure).- Decent location; area may at first seem a little dicey but after spending a little time walking around you'll realize that the area is fine. It's also within walking distance to a number of things to see (such as Las Ramblas, martime museum, etc). - Easy to use, free wi-fi internet (bring your laptop!). The front desk can issue you a username/password to connect. Negatives:My room was VERY small. Of course it kept me out doing things which ended up being better for me in the end.No room service.Overall, I'd say it was a decent value (especially compared to the very expensive Grand Marina where several of my colleagues stayed -- and they charge an extra $29 E a day just for the internet access). I'd also highly recommend taking one of those Turist buses (with the open tops). They continually run along designated routes in the city and you can get 1 and 2 day passes with unlimited on and off privileges during the 1 or 2 day period. The blue line is the shorter one but still has MANY interesting stops in Barcelona (and from the open air top you see things that you couldn't see in a car, taxi, or even walking).
