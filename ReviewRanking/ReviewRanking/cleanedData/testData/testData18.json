We paid 180SGD/night (110 USD), inclusive of all taxes and charges. For this price, I would say that we got a good bargain given that the hotel was in a good location and had very likeable facilities. This hotel has a good arrival, it has a big facade, and immediately tells you that you are going to have a good stay. A bellhop cheerfully collected our luggage as we checked in in less than 15 mins. It was 11am at the time but the receptionist gave us our rooms right away without early check-in charges.The hotel's configuration is quite unique. We had to negotiate about 7 turns along the corridors since our room was quite far from the elevator. In our excitement to walk around Orchard, this is something we can easily forgive.Our room was a decent Superior room. It had a decent amount of space (just enough), right amount of furnishings and amenities (a sofa and side table, TV, bar, internet, office desk). It has a walk-in closet where the luggage counter is integrated. The bathroom was clean, had a bathtub, hot shower and toiletries. I coudln't find anything that I didn't like. The bed was good, wasn't hard or soft, it was just right. The bedsheets and pillocases felt good on the skin. We had a good night's rest every night. We also used the Internet (7SGD for 30 mins) just to check on e-mail, not bad at all. We also received a daily copy of the Straits Times, good for waiting while the spouse was int he bathroom.We didn't get the chance to try out the other facilities (swimming pool, bar, restaurants), since we just used the room for sleeping and showering. But this is a great-value hotel for this price! It met our minimum requirements, decent staff, good facilities (not spectacular, but good enough), and for that price, it's worth considering for a future stay.

(i know all this bcuz i was standing at the frontdesk asking to be checked in before anyone approached me for a good 10 mins. and 10 mins is a long time)all this could probably be becuz im a local. not a tourist. so they rather prioritize the tourists bcuz the tourists are future advocators of the hotel to help spread the word abt the hotel worldwide.the corridors are seriously eerie. so silent that i could HEAR the silence. me and friends experienced some eerie stuffs in the room too. For the amount that i paid for a family suite 600SGD plus or minus, i think that its overpriced and nothing to be wowed abt.For tourists, yes its a good location being that it is in the center of country n near Orchard Rd, but im sure u guys cud use the money and stay somewhr else that is worth the money. Anyways, Singapore is so small, it doesnt matter even if ur not staying in the heart of the city or the center of the country. Frm one end of the country to the other end it only take about 1 hr + to travel by train or at a lesser time by legitimate taxis/cabs.Venture out of the usual comfort zone and you'll be surprise by what other great hotels Singapore have got to offer.

She insisted there was nothing they could do, so I asked if she could recommed a hotel that could accomodate me. She handed me a phone book and carried on wioth other business. I was shocked at hold cold she was! THEN...I asked if I paid more, could they accomodate me. Of course they could, money talks (why didnt she just say that in the first place?) We had to pay to upgrade to a room with a King (even though that is in fact what we paid for on-line) and priveledges to use the Business Center which included nightly cocktails and hordervs.Stuart Anderson: As we waited for our room, we decided to eat here for lunch, it was familiar. In the entire restraunt there was my husband  I, and 3 other families. Once our food came, we never saw the waitress again. She left for the day and nobody took her place to help us. Horrible service!Business Center: It was actually very nice and the staff in here was friendly. The most friendly in the entire hotel. We got to know some of the staff and they spilled the beans on managment problems...saying all staff is unhappy. Our room came with a cocktail hour..but the staff admitted they did not know how to make cocktails. When we asked for drinks, they had no idea what the liquors were called so they allowed to go to the back and pull the liquor ourselves. Only one computer worked the entire time we were there. Light breakfast was also included...not bad.Pool: Nice, quiet, and clean. However, 1 outdoor shower busted and water poured out for over an hour. We let them know, but it obviously wasnt a priority.Salon: At the time we were there, there were 2 salons. One had been located in the Hotel for years and owned by an older woman, the other was fairly new and more modern. I visited the older one...she too spilled her beans as to how horrible the managment has been to everyone.Bottom Line: I would not recommend this hotel to anyone nor would I ever return.

The bathroom, however, seemed to be the cause of my problems. The noise that the plumbing makes (all though the night) is horrendous. My own shower water gargled away for ages after the shower had finished, but worse still the drainage pipes from the upper floors must run directly past my room and made a constant racket all night long.The lobby of the hotel smells overpoweringly of lemon. I found the aroma quite off putting each time that I passed through.Breakfast on the second floor (you get little blue vouchers for each day of your stay) was adequate but only just. The food laid out was quite basic. The made-to-order omelettes were good but I found that I had to wait a long time for them to be cooked. I was staying on my own at the hotel and had to share tables at breakfast each day (the eating area is not that large).

We could never figure out why they offer American buffet breakfast for ordinary rooms, but only 10 choices of food selection for exeucitve rooms.

That means every morning, we had to take the lift to have breakfast, and wait for the lift again to be able to go out.From my room, I could hear pumping music even after midnight. Later my colleagues told me that there was a disco located downstairs. Also, I realized that the balcony door was unable to be locked...Finally, it was the check out time. I was thinking to take advantage of my executive room previledge.

Meaning that I could have just waited there in the room (based on what they told me) the whole night and no one would have come up!The saga continued when the replacement room I was given was not even made up yet after the previous guests left! Thought mine was probably a one-off case until I was passing by the hotel's reception the next evening and overheard an angry guest at the reception shouting that this was the hotel with the worst service he had ever been to.

Had we not been so tired when we arrived at about 9:30 PM, after seeing the room allocated to us I would gladly have paid to go to another hotel. The Orchard Parade is a very tired hotel, particularly once you get past the reception area.Check-in took ages despite us having a confirmed reservation. We weren't offered porter assistance, possibly because we had only pull along cabin bags. This was unfortunate because the room we were allocated took some finding. It was tucked away in a dark corner behind the elevators, in the opposite direction to every other room on that floor. After finally locating the room and opening the door, we quickly guessed that it must be a special room kept for unsuspecting travellers whose accommodation is being paid for by an airline.We were presented with a quite depressing room. It was clean enough, apart from the stained carpet, and the linen was acceptable. However, the bathroom was tiny, tired and hideously decorated. The mould encrustation between the tiles was a nice decorative touch though, as was the colony of mould or mildew growing on the ceiling of the bathroom. The accent on mould growth carried through into the bedroom, which had a matching growth on the ceiling and colonies of mould about 5 mm long growing out of the aircon outlet. Mould must make aircon more effective because the efficiency of the aircon was the room's saving grace.It was difficult to see much of the other non-organic decoration in the room because of the poor lighting, although we did see that the room had been repainted relatively recently. It was a pity that the Hotel reinstalled the original scratched and dirt-encrusted electrical switches and outlets, some of which weren't fixed too well to the wall.As another reviewer observed, free entertainment is provided by the almost non-existant soundproofing in the rooms. We tossed and turned for some time whilst being forced to listen to a conversation, at normal conversational level I might add, between guests in the room on the other side of the bathroom wall some 5 m away.After a restful night's sleep we attended the restaurant for breakfast, only to be told that meals were not included. This was despite 'all meals' being clearly annotated on the accommodation voucher provided to us. However, after a visit to reception and a discussion with the Duty Manager we were allowed to eat what turned out to be a very good breakfast served by very friendly and attentive staff in a nicely decorated restaurant. Whilst eating, though, we observed at least six other guests experience the same 'misunderstanding' over the inclusion of breakfast in the room rate.Check-out took ages again and, despite my discussion with the Manager only an hour beforehand, we were charged initially for breakfast and for room service that we neither ordered nor received. This was resolved once more with the Manager, with whom I was almost on a first name basis by now, and we left happy to see the Orchard Parade sip into the distance behind our taxi.Would I recommend this hotel? Definitely; for demolition.

We arrived at the orchard hotel at approx 2030 Singapore time and proceeded to the check in desk and explained we had a confirmed and paid for booking for the night to be told that they had no record of our booking and were fully booked for the night.We produced our paperwork confirming our booking and the duty manager was called to investigate the situation.The duty manager, Andrew Fletcher contacted the hotels main reservation dept and endeavoured to find a solution to the unfortunate situation. During this time I contacted our agents customer service department on my mobile phone to see if they were able to resolve the situation or offer advice as to what could be done or what the situation was.The Duty Manager after his several phone calls then informed us that the hotel was indeed already overbooked and our booking definitely did not exist within their booking system and therefore we would be unable to stay at the orchard hotel for the night.I was at this time still on the phone to our agents customer service dept where I was being told that according to them our booking had been processed and confirmed and therefore I would have accommodation at the hotel in question. I informed them that this was not the case and asked her to arrange for a suitable hotel to be found for us to spend the night.After several long conversations with customer service I was informed that it was not possible for them to source us alternative accommodation for the evening and that the only advice she could offer was for us to 鈥榬eturn to the airport and spend the night sleeping there in the departure lounge鈥?At this stage the duty manager of the orchard hotel, who could not believe the advice of our agent took it upon himself to try and find us alternative accommodation himself by contacting several local hotels and finally managed to find us a room in a hotel close to the orchard. He then directed his staff to take us and our bags to this hotel and book us in. So although we did not stay here we certainly got a superb impression of the staffs level of customer care.
