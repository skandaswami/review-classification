However, you have to cut across the huge station or walk around it to get to the shops and restaurants. Better for those on business or want a quiet retreat. The bed is comfortable but what is very strange are the square pillows which are ok for kids but very uncomfortable for adults. These are OK as cushions but entirely inappropriate for a business class hotel. The shower and amenities are good and there is a nice flatscreen TV with CNN, BBC and movies on demand. The wireless broadband is fast but expensive. The breakfast is good and the reception staff are very polite, responsive and speak good English.

We had a good size family room, very clean, high standard room with good bathroom, toiletries, tea making facilities and fridge. We found it to be very good value for a family room in Paris. The location is good, in a quiet residential street close to Montparnasse station. If you arrive by Eurostar you can get the metro line 4 direct to Montparnasse from Gare du Nord. There is a lively theatre area very close by with some good value places to eat as well as more expensive brasseries. The metro is nearby, but we mostly used buses, which take you to the main tourist areas, and are easy to work out with clear information about routes, stops and times at every stop. You can get books of tickets from the machine in the metro station which can be used for both. The hotel service and staff were fine, except the breakfast on Sunday was dire, everyone arrived at once so we had to queue to be seated, all tables were full, and we had to queue for bread, toast and juice. They did knock it off the bill when we complained. Also beware of the drinks prices in the bar. We managed to spend about 拢60 over three nights on a couple of drinks each.

The hotel is generally very nice - modern furniture and a rather contemporary look and feel. Upon check-in, the staff was very courteous and professional. We arrived shortly before the noon check-in, but were not allowed to check-in early. We were, however, allowed to leave our luggage in the locked side office until our room was ready, so we used the time to walk around the neighborhood and get acquainted with what was nearby (which is A LOT in terms of coffee shops, restaurants, and the mall - which is one of the 'Gallerie Lafayette' shopping centers).When we did check-in, we were given a room on the second floor which was pleasantly clean and presentable. Linens were plentiful and we were generally overall happy with the accomodation. Interestingly, the room had two separate bathroom areas. The first was the actual toilet room, which was immediately to the right upon entering the hotel room. The other, the bathing room (equipped with full shower, sink, and tub) was in the general vacinity of the bedroom area. Although we are not traditionally accustomed to this set-up, we assumed it to be characteristic of the hotels in Paris. Compared to other hotel room stays, we found the room to be on the smaller end in size, so the separation of the two bathroom areas was not all too bothersome. Our only negative observation - which we had read about in another review - was that the shower door did not close properly. It appeared as if it had not been properly installed. It was difficult to close at times and it leaked water out onto the bathroom floor. We did not dine in the hotel restaurant, but we did frequent the bar area and were pleased with the drink selection as well as the late-night appetizer/tapas menu. The bar staff was courteous and the environment friendly. We did have breakfast in the restaurant area on our second day; however, we did not particularly care for our experience or the selection of food. In researching our stay at this hotel, we were aware that many of the guests are on business-related trips, as the hotel is in a financial/business district. As such, most of the quests staying at the hotel were on business, but we did find other guests traveling on vacation, as well as families with small children. In any case, upon coming down for breakfast on the second morning, we waited in line as the maitre d' seated guests in the restaurant area. Our turn came up in line, but rather than seating us, the maitre d' turned to a number of guests to our right and sat them beforehand. These folks were clearly dressed in business attire whereas my husband and I were more dressed down. I mentioned to the maitre d' that I didn't think it was very courteous of him to have seated others before us when we had clearly been waiting in line. He said he understood my concern, but then added that there was no need to make an issue of it. I thought otherwise, and later mentioned the incident at the front desk. The receptionist was very understanding and apologetic and offered to remove the charges for breakfast. She even made a point to say that the hotel treats all guests the same, whether they are on business or not. As for the breakfast, we were not entirely impressed with the selection and would highly recommend stopping at one of the many creperies or coffee shops in Paris as the selection tends to be plentiful and more characteristic of Paris. Lastly worth mentioning is that, one of the best features of this hotel is that it is located right next to the Gare Montparnesse which has easy train and metro access. Literally, almost every metro line can be picked up here. We were comforted in knowing how easy it was to travel about Paris and how accessible we were to this main hub. It definitely gave us a good feeling in knowing that we could get anywhere we needed to go in the city, without having to be directly in the center of Paris. If we were to return to Paris, we would highly consider staying at this hotel again. The accomodations were pleasing and the location was very convenient. If you are looking to stay here, we recommend booking directly through the Novotel's website. There are several promotions (City Breaks, Early Booking) which apply to certain Novotel hotels - we booked early, but under a no change, no cancellation promotion - and were able to get a great rate.

My booking this hotel was based on reading good reviews from other visitors.On arrival our impressions were mixed. The location is reasonable, but even though it is close to the departure end of Montparnasse SNCF station, the metro is a very lengthy 20 minute walk from the hotel through a packed station. Also, it is not on the RER line so travel across Paris to Gare du Nord can take about half an hour, not including the walk from hotel to metro.The receptionist was very much the pushy salesman, buttering us up by offering our daughter a cuddly toy and then giving her two (even though he gave two to every child!), then pushing their loyalty card on us with a big sales pitch about it all. It took ages to just check in and get to our room when we were all very tired.On both occasions there was no cot in the room and none forthcoming when asked, despite having booked this in advance.The website gave the impression that the hotel was very child friendly and that there was a play area in the hotel for young children, however, there was no such play area.The room was small with not that much storage space for clothes, but luckily we were only staying one night.We were told on the website that there was unlimited tea and coffee, but found in the room just one sachet of coffee and one very small sachet of milk, not even enough for one person to have one drink! Also, the cups were two of the most revolting plastic containers I've ever seen; I didn't even realise they were cups at first! Not what one expects from this class of hotel, especially as staying in a Mercure (supposedly a lower class of hotel) in Calais the night before we had a lot of coffee sachets and very nice real mugs.The Novotel also had no minibar, just a small bottle of water in the fridge.There was WIFI in the room but a payable service. There was a terminal in the lobby that was free to use for twenty minutes at a time.The one good thing about the hotel was the breakfast, which was varied, with cereals, fruit, cold meat, bacon, eggs and sausage etc., although no better than any other hotel we've stayed in. It did cost 16 euros each though!All in all we were not that impressed and won't stay there again, or in a Novotel. It just wasn't up to the standards one would expect from that class of hotel charging the high rate we paid for each night. There are also better located hotels nearer the RER lines as well as the metro if you want to enjoy Paris and get round quickly. The location was fine for us as we were travelling from Montparnasse SNCF station the next morning.All in all, mixed feelings and not as great for families as other reviews make out.

Several routes on the METRO pass through Montparnasse enabling you to get to various places without changing trains. The Montparnasse area other wise is extremely nice with many cafes and restaurants dotting the area. The hotel staff especially the reception are friendly and helpful. Rooms are moderate sized and our rooms had a separate sofa cum bed for my 9 year old daugher. Bathrooms are somewhat small with the toilet being separated from the bathroom, a new one for me. A flat screen TV and a well stocked tea and coffee making service are nice touches. The hotel facilities look well maintained and new. A free internet facility in the lobby is a great additional facilities should you need an urgent dekko. The breakfast range is quite good and can be considered superior to what one is used to at many european hotels. Reasonable options for veggies including a comprehensive range of muesli, corn flakes, flavoured yoghurt and the like, besides breads, and croissants, fruits et al. For all Indians, several decent joints serving Indian veg and non veg food. Try the Etoile Kashmir on Boulevard Du Montparnasse about a 7-8 minute walk from the hotel.

The room was lovely and the kids fold out beds were ideal for them as they're just kids and that's what they're designed for, there was a mini fridge and safe and TV / internet etc. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment but it's location is a 20 min walk to the eiffel tower which can be seen from 50yds from the hotel, the GARE MONTPARNASSE (Main railway station)and metro is about 100 metres away unless you choose PASTEUR metro stop which is a 5 to 10 min stroll which is fine for kids too. We really had no complaint at all with this hotel. They even allowed late check out without any quibble and we'd definetly stay again if we needed to visit paris again.The only minor thing I could pick them up on is we gave them 3 bits of luggage and only received 1 tag which I questioned, when returning our luggage was all still there so no problems but i suppose it could of been had a bag disappeared, however, that said if that's all I can complain about then I'm happy !!!, this was a really nice find in paris.

It was very clean, equipped with all necessities any vacationer would ask for (i.e. TV, Refrigerator, Closet, etc..) . More than we expected really! My wife even loved it! The bathroom was awesome. We had a huge bed which was not expected considering we were in Paris...again, *applause*In comparisson to other hotels within the vicinity, this one is competitively priced. I give an A++ for cleanliness no doubt. The location puts you in a quiet area but yet easily accessible. It's in the mid-point of almost all spots you would want to see when you're in Paris. Like almost everything else there, you'll need to exercise your legs since you'll be walking alot. Familiarize yourself with the map and you'll see.There was one female staff member who was not as friendly as the others but I guess it was due to being in the night shift.

Had a great stay here. My husband and I arrived late afternoon and we were just about to ask if any rooms had a view of the Eiffel Tower when the receptionist said he was looking for a room with a view for us.We were given a room on the 7th floor and had not only a great view of the Eiffel Tower, but also our own private balcony (only available on 7th floor rooms). We'd also managed to arrive on Bastille Day so we enjoyed a wonderful firework display that night from the comfort of our own balcony.The room was appointed well - just enough storage space for 2. The bathroom had a walk in shower - no bath, but that wasn't a problem. The shower pressure was good with the usual toiletries (shampoo, body lotion, body wash).The bed was comfortable but as seems to be usual practice in some European hotels, the pillows were rubbish!!We managed to get a good early rate deal from Novotel's website for this trip which included breakfast. There was a selection of hot and cold self serve buffet food, but I don't think it warranted the individual breakfast price for those who wish to pay extra.The location was good - very quiet. After a couple of days we figured out which railway station exit to use - head for the Port Oceane exit followed by the signs for Vaugirard 3 - this exit brings you out 50 yards from the hotel. Alternatively, the elusive 'back way' from the railway station at Vaugirard opens directly onto the back door of the hotel - great if you can find it.Overall this hotel was very good - would definitely stay here again. Even more worth it if you can get a good deal!!

You can do better! The staff was VERY helpful and friendly. I give them an applause! The lobby was basic but nice enough. The family size rooms (rooms for 3 or 4 guests) left much to be desired (I give it only 2 stars by US standards). It had one large bed (probably queen size) that felt like a fold out bed mattress and it had a sofa that pulled out to either one or two twin size cot beds that were very thin in which one could feel the springs. The room was very plain and small. Nothing cute, charming or comfortable. Just a basic place to sleep and rest your weary body after long days touring Paris. If no frills, plain and basic, clean is what you desire, then this could be the place for you. It was clean. However, the carpets were spotted. Sheets were clean and shower was clean. If I had to do it all over again, I would not stay here. I beleive if you look hard and ask around, you could find a nice boutique hotel with some character for either the same rate or slightly more. You might have to forfeit breakfast included though. The breakfast that came with this room was quite nice - lots of rolls, jams, butter, coffee/tea/cocao. Another downfall in my opionon is that from this hotel, it always required a Metro ride to get to where you want/need to go. Not a long one, but still a ride. The immediate area around the hotel was very blah. As you head toward the Metro station, there are some decent restaurants and a better neighborhood. My questions is, why not stay someplace that you can walk out of your hotel and stroll immediately down quaint nice streets with the charming Paris feeling? It takes some shopping around to find it though, I guess. If I had to do it over again, knowing what I know, I would Google nice hotels in the MontMartre area. I saw some really cute ones while strolling the streets.if you do stay at this Novotel hotel and you have two people, ask for room 712. We had that for one of the 3 nights we stayed at the hotel and it was GREAT compared to the family size rooms. Had a nice and sizeable balcony that looked at the Eifel Tower. This night in this room redeemed the hotel from a great disappointment to something other than that. If we had that room the entire stay, it would have probably been worth staying there. I do think that this is the best room in the entire hotel. The room on either side of this one did not have a view of the Eifel tower as far as I could tell.One tip that I learned on this Europe Tour: DO NOT BE TEMPTED BY PREPAYING YOUR HOTEL TO GET A GOOD RATE. IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO CANCEL OR CHANGE YOUR RESERVATION. IT'S WORTH THE RISK TO TAKE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER RATE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CANCEL IF YOU ARE NOT THRILLED WITH YOUR CHOICE ONCE YOU GET THERE!

For food, we found it better to eat a lot a lunchtime and just buy baguettes and pastries for dinner - but that's just me. I would recommend a cafe called 'Le 234 Tuilleries' near Tuilleries metro. The service and food was excellent.One thing to bear in mind ... the rooms use the two-pin plugs (but not the standard ones that you can buy in the UK - the plug sockets have holes for two pins and a bit that sticks out and locks into the plug itself). You can borrow a plug from reception but they charge you 20 euros for every use.All in all, a brilliant place to stay, and I hope other hotels can live up to this standard.

We drove to Paris from the UK and chose this hotel for its underground parking and proximity to the metro station. Parking was charged at 15 euros per day but gave us complete peace of mind and the cark park had a lift directly to the hotel reception. We are a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 children aged 6  9. The man at reception who checked us in was most helpful. His English was great but he took the time to help us along with our very basic French which the kids enjoyed.We had booked a family room which had a large king size bed and a double sofa bed. The rooms were very spacious and looked like they had been recently refurbed. Breakfast was included in our rate. It consisted of the usual continental bits as well as bacon, sausages and some rather runny eggs. I wouldn't recommend the breakfast hot stuff but the continental was pretty good. The hotel has room service which we used on our first night. Service was fast and the food of a good standard although a little pricey. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Pasteur metro station. Pasteur is only 5 stops from the Eiffel Tower. We used the metro to get around to all the Paris attractions. I would recommend buying a carnet (10 tickets). Each ticket is a one way journey to wherever you want to go and do not have to be used up in one day. The cost was 11 euros for 10 adult tickets and half of that for the kids carnet. All in all, we couldn't fault this place. For the price you are getting a very good hotel, close to the tube with a very good car park. Would definitely visit again.

Asked for directions to the hotel which was about 1/2 a mile away up a slight hill. We found it right away and dropped our bags off and went back into the main town for breakfast for 7 euros each.We were able to gain access to the room at noon. We were on the 7th floor. The room was fantastic, quiet, and the fridge was useful for cool drinks. The Hotel is on the edge of Paris but the cost is a lot less than paying for city-centre hotels. It is only 4 stops or so from the Eff Tower.We actually walked into Paris and back on the first day. It is about 2 to 3 miles but flat and almost one continuous road to the the Tower.We bought at 3-day metro pass which cost 55 euros for 3 of us.We also went on the red hop-on/hop off tour bus for a 2 day pass and cruise on the river for 79 euros for the 3 of us. We went up the tower which was 4 euros each to walk up the stairs. I am not that healthy, overweight and nearly 50 but I made it up the almost 700 steps with a feeling of achievement. You can then get the lift to the 3rd floor but the queues were excessive. Of course you can take the lift up to all 3 floors for 12 euros eachWith the Metro ticket you can get a 35% discount off the price of the Montparnasse Tower. This reduced it to 6 euros. This is well worth it to get a different perspective on Paris. Be sure to go on the 59th Floor Terrace for open views across the city.Eating out can be expensive but part of the challenge is to find value for money restaurants. Ask the Parisans, I found them very polite and most helpful. I speak no french at all but an appealing/lost puppy look gets you a lot of help.Overall, our first time in Paris was super.

We liked the separation of the toilet from the rest of the bathroom, and appreciated the shower and full bath. The queen-sized bed was firm but not hard.

Furthermore, it requires a short but not steep uphill climb, but nothing like the steps of Montmarte.The hotel lacks the charme and the atmosphere of the older hotels (and their neighborhoods) that we have stayed in, but makes up for it with its cleanliness, breakfast, and quiet location. If walking is a problem you'll want to consider a more central location nearer the river and major sites.

The main reason I chose this hotel was because it's right next to the Gare Montparnasse train station. This trip was for work and I took the train to the suburbs each day. This hotel is a new hotel with a very modern design to it. Sometimes the design works other times it looked a little cheap. Very streamline and Euro looking. But I did like it. The hotel was extremely clean and very quiet. It had a small refrigerator, hair dryer, internet access (for a cost). What it didn't have was a clock or an iron. I never asked the front desk to see if I could get one. The bathroom was nicely done with a separate shower and large, deep tub. It had a small storage/closet place for your clothes. I booked this room with only 2 day notice and paid $220 a night. Seemed a little high but it is Paris. The lobby was nice and it had a cool bar area with a little restaurant off the lobby. The hotel is in a good area, about 1 mile east of the Eiffel Tower and a mile south of Notre Dame. With the train/subway all sites are easy to get to. This place is not your old charming Paris hotel like some picture but it is nice. I would definitely stay here again but would also entertain other options based on price.

We have just returned from an excellent trip to Paris, really enjoyable! This hotel was superb - all the staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful and polite.

The rooms are a good size, with flat screen TV, internet access (wireless and on the TV - charged in 24 hour sessions), fridge, safe and tea and coffee making facilities. Air-con is a bonus too! It's also only a 5 minute walk from the metro station Pasteur, on line 6 and 12 - which is only 5 stops from the Eiffel Tower.We didn't eat at the hotel as we thought it was too expensive (16 euros for breakfast!) and tended to buy croissants etc from the local supermarkets.We followed the advise on this site and bought an orange carte, rather than the paris visite which is a lot cheaper if you're going for a few days (don't forget your passport photo). We spent a day at Disneyland which was great. There were queues for many of the rides, but the fastpass service is really good - and free! So try it if you're going! Also don't miss the Tarzan show!We booked about 3 months in advance, and got a 3 nights for the price of 2 deal, through expedia, which was a lot cheaper than the hotels website.

Booked a double room for my parents (late sixties) and a triple room for my husband, me and our teenage daughter. My parents stayed in room 817 which gave them an uninterrupted view of the Eiffel Tower, which was an added bonus. The double rooms are massive by Paris standards and our triple room had a bathroom with a separate toilet. The beds are super king size and the most comfortable I've ever slept in away from home. The hotel is very modern and exceptionally clean. Toiletries were replenished every day and unless you left a leaflet on your bed each morning to say that you were happy to have the bed linen left on your bed from the night before the staff would change your bed each day!Breakfast was a delight and although we were told that it can get busy we never had to wait for a table. Perhaps this is because we ate at 8.00 am each day!The hotel isn't in the centre of Paris and you will need to walk for approx. 5-7 mins to the nearest Metro station (Pasteur) but the journey into the city centre is only about 10 mins. The hotel is based in a business district but is very quiet. The rooms are very well insulated and therefore noise was kept to a minimum.Overall, I would totally recommend a stay at this hotel.

The best that we found was the Pot au Feu in Rue Pasteur, 300 yards away. A taxi back to Charles de Gaulle airport was 62 euros although this is better than travel via metro and RER, with luggage.
