I'm sure anyone reading this now has already gathered from previous reviews and pictures that this hotel has a crazy colored light thing going on. Other than that, everything else is starkly white, giving the room a super-modern, clean and sleek feel. The lights are fun and the premise is interesting, but I have to say that it did slightly lose it's appeal as our stay went on. I really don't have many negative things to say about our stay, however. The hotel's basic policy seems to be that rather than have the staff serve you, you should already have pretty much everything you need. This was true for the most part, although it does lend to kind of an impersonal experience. We fully utilized the help yourself room which comes equipped with free water, coffee and tea, as well as a little loungey area and a computer hooked up with free internet. There's also a little vending machine stocked with juice, beer, snacks, etc. for a reasonable price.The location was great - right in between the historic area of the Born district and the park. Born is packed with cute cafes and shops, so we had a lot of fun just browsing around the area. We had a street-facing room which opened to a small balcony. I don't usually mind background traffic noise (living in NYC), but there was some construction going on while we there that tended to be extremely loud. I'm pretty sure they were even doing some work out there in the middle of the night one night, which did not make for a good night's sleep. The bed was super comfy, though, so I guess that made up for it to an extent.In summary, I would recommend this hotel to a younger crowd looking for a funky, unique hotel experience. My husband and I were actually on our honeymoon, and it was perfect for this kind of trip. I probably would not want to stay more than a few nights though.

The first time was in Sept. 2007. We planned a quick, 4-day trip in Barcelona, and decided to stay here again, as our last stay in this hotel was only for one night. When I arrived around noon, I asked in Spanish if the clerk spoke English. My boyfriend and I speak as much Spanish as we can (no matter how poorly) when we travel to Spain. She actually rolled her eyes at me and said impatiently, in English, yes, of course. It was a bad start. It certainly didn't make me feel very welcome. I found out that the room wouldn't be ready for a while, so I wandered out. When I returned, it was the same clerk, but somehow, she had transformed into a very friendly and helpful person. I was glad. She did a lot for me in as far as continually checking with the maids and trying to make sure I got the first clean room available. She was so helpful that I forgot about my greeting.The room itself was as nice as before. It was clean. I love the design. We both love the shower in the middle of the room. I don't mind the lack of space in the room either. There is no proper closet, but there is a small area with a little bar with hangers on which to hang your clothes. The hotel is in our favorite area of Barcelona--the Born district. In our opinion, it has the best bars, restaurants and shopping. I love that area. The Metro is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel, which is nice. We would get home late and take advantage of sitting on the tiny balcony, which was particularly good for people watching.One reason I wouldn't stay here again is that the bathroom/toilet room isn't very private. It's glass, with a partial smoky glass area for privacy, but the door has an open space at the top, and in addition, our door didn't close completely. The only other complaint I have, but it's tiny, is that the maids walked in on us, even though we were yelling, in Spanish, please come back later. We thought it was weird that they walked in because hall noise was visible from the room--another minor complaint. Those are the only complaints. If you wouldn't be bothered by what I mentioned, I would highly recommend this hotel.

They could not have been more accommodating - when we arrived it was pouring with rain, so when we checked in (early and not a problem) he noticed our room smelt of sewage (just dodgy Spanish drains I think!), so the manager called our room and offered to move us. We accepted and were moved to a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony and some beautiful original features etc. The rooms are not huge, we booked a large and it was ample, but as the building is so old, I imagine every room differs somewhat (we saw 2 and they were similar sizes but very different shapes). The lighting is a real feature and a novelty! The bathroom and shower are really original too. Beds really firm (we both have bad backs!) There is a free safe you can use and the free refreshments are brilliant. Excellent location, literally 3 minutes from the Born area and all other areas lead off that too. We ended up eating and drinking in the Born area as it was more our style (little funky boutiques, jewellery shops, bars, cafes, restaurants) and very local. We ate in various places and would highly recommend each - Bilbao Barras - fab relaxed Tapas help yourself to as much as you want - great for lunch ( a bit smoky - there is no ban in Spain!). Cheese Me - if you love cheese and wine, you will love this! Then a lovely Tapas restaurant with loads of vegetarian options - cannot remember the name, but on the street behind Santa Maria church, down from the Gaudi Museum and opposite a Tea shop (it's black and white and modern looking). Excellent service, brilliant english, fresh, well made food. We loved all the wine shops that were also cafes too as well as the Chocolate and Churros!!! Barcelona is an exhausting city but there are so many places to sit and chill as well we loved it! The only down sides for us were the weather and the fact we flew with Ryan air who fly into Gerona, not Barcelona - although the bus system is VERY well organised, it cuts into your time there (1 hr 15 on bus). Overall Chic and Basic is V reasonable for the location, service, style, facilities and we would definately return. The White Bar (part of the hotel) says it is a cocktail bar as well as restaurant, it isn't - but looked good if you dont want to walk anywhere. We booked direct with the hotel as none of the discount sites had rooms avail and it cost us 拢270 for 2 nights in a Large room.

The room is a comfortable size for one person. It has a double bed, door to the courtyard which lets sunlight in. The room is very well designed. It had everything I needed. Clean uncluttered space, fantastic flat screen interactive TV - reminds me of the Singapore Airline interactive TV. The led lights were in fact quite fun to play around with - set different moods with the different lights. The service is friendly. Internet is FREE. Coffee, tea and the most essential water which seems to be sorely lacking even in more expensive hotels in Barcelona is in abundance - just help yourself in the self service area.

The building itself has a real depth of history and they manage to combine this really well with the stark whiteness of the rooms and the funky decor and lighting, it did look a bit tired in areas (window frames needing a lick of paint) but this didn't detract from the whole experience. The help yourself bar of coffee and bottled water and vending machines of other drinks including alcohol were great.All this coupled with a really good location in the Born district made for a perfect weekend visit. The only off thing was outside the hotel where there was a really funny sulphuric type smell, but don't worry this didn't permeate inside.

The strange thing is that it didn't have any windows at all, which made it really claustrophobic! It had 2 windows that when you opened them, you looked out on an old elevator shoot. That must be how the roach got in the room! It had some cool skylights though in the ceiling. The problem with that is that they had a sky light directly above the shower. As I took a shower, I looked up into the blue sky and a man on the 4th floor of the next building who was looking down watching me take a shower! I couldn't believe it. He even had to put his hand up to block the sun's glare a few times. This made me mad. Needless to say, we asked to be moved and told them about the guy on the roof. No apologies, but the next day we got a room with a balcony. The bad thing here is that we couldn't sleep the next few nights because of all the street noise. (We were on the street with all the large garage bins and a yappy dog who barked constantly. There must be a dozen different trash companies, because they came at different times one morning to get the trash). We won't be staying here again. It was a disappointment!The good things included the location, the air conditioning the cool lights  the free water.

Also the bar was really great you gotta try the Sex in Barcelona so delish, and I do not like fruity drinks.

The staff were very friendly and had better english than me!!The room was very cool (ie chic) and cool (ie not warm) and just what we were looking for. THe lighting in the rooms was exceptional and although not massive (we stayed in a medium room) had everything we needed. The attention to detail was impressive and although the minimal white walls, linen, corridors etc might not be to everyone's taste we thought it looked great and was really clean and fresh feeling. The hotel had a really great mix between old (cornisting, tiled floors, marble bannisters) and new (neon lighting, balearic music, and young, funky staff).The best thing for us (a couple in our mid twenties who like art and design and nice bars etc) was the area. It's well away from the tourist trap of La Rambla in a semi-residential area but right next to the beautiful park, 10 mins from barceloneta beach, 2 mins from a metro and right next to a vast range of really cool bars and restaurants (esp Pitin bar and Santa Maria). I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough (we were actually supposed to stay for 3 nights but ended up staying for 6 because we weren't very impressed with the other area we had booked in - Eixample). I just hope it doesn't get too popular so we can get a room again when we go back, which we definately will.

It is in C/ Princesa, in the very trendy Born district and you can walk to many attractions from here. The room I had was very comfortable and stylish, and really enjoyable to stay in. I requested a quiet room, so I got one facing an internal courtyard and not the main street, which was great for me. The different lights in the room are really cool and you can modify the colour of your room according to your mood.Following recommendations from tripadvisor, I skipped having breakfast at the stylish 鈥榃hite Bar鈥? and had a massive cheese sandwich and coffee in the caf茅 just around the corner for 4 euros.

I love this type of hotel and if you look they have lots of this type of thing in Sapin. I'm talking about these new hotels that are like 'design' or 'boutique' hotels without paying the silly expensive prices and they are not part of a big hotel chain.Chic and Basic in Born is set in a beautiful old building yet all the rooms are up to date and very stylish. I agree with all the previous reviews saying that you must know your travelling partner very well as the shower is very see through! The whole idea of the room is very 'chill out' or night clubbish. The location is totally unbeatable as you are staying in the most interesting of areas for little shops and restaurants. If you want MacDonalds etc then stay somewhere else. In Born you will find lots of little shops where you feel you are buying souveniers or presents that are really special.We walked the whole of Barcelona and couldn't find a better area. Inside the room the television is a huge flat screen with loads of multimedia (but why would you stay inside all the time)?! The shower and the toiletries are all so stylish. It is true that the door had to be slamed quite hard for it to shut properly, so you also hear your neighbours trying to do that. It can be loud. Also the noise outside on Friday and Saturday nights can be loud as Spanish people stay up late partying!I love Barcelona and I love Chic and Basic and I would recomend it to all of my young friends.

Bruises were sustained, 450 Euros stolen, and another purse with business information as it's contents stolen.

Safety deposit boxes were available at reception but I think a 3* hotel of this calibre should have them in the room.The shower is in the middle of the room which is not clear from the pictures on travel agents websites!! There is a curtain which you can pull round but if you're at all shy I'd give it a miss. This probably makes the hotel more suited to couples than friends but we survived!Definately avoid the breakfast. We went once and it was awful. There was no butter or jam so my friend had dry toast.

In its essence, it remains a totally wacked out place that I would recommend highly to the following people:a)young travelers, b)travelers with a sense of humor c) uninhibited couples d)fashionistas....Chic and basic combines old Barcelona with CRAZY Nuevo fun. All staircases are old marble, while the walls of the rooms are covered in mirrors, shiny plastic, and colored lights. I recommended it for the youthful, as there were some room set ups that i feared my parents would break a hip on (the 2 steps to the bathroom can be terrifying at night)...As for the light curtains, the verdict is still out on them...they reminded me of trecking through the forest with a buddy...if yer not considerate of yer friend whist amidst thick forestation, yer friend is bound to get a mouthful of plant....chic and basic's curtains were of these same variety and I, unthinking, slapped my dude with a heavy curtain on a number of occassions.As for the uninhibited, the shower is something out of Barberella- a glass enclosed tube that, unless yer travel partner has seen you bathing naked, you may be aghast about (so much that i would say i probably wouldn't be keen on staying here with good friend..(i.e. without privileges)However, I found the place fun, totally disorientating, but a hoot...very clean, and personally, i loved the design, though if yer looking for something old school BCN, this may not be the joint.Negatives: we never got our volume to work on the super cool flat screen TV, and, by Friday, they stopped stocking the help you bar with water.
