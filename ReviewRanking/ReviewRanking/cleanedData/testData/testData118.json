On checking-out at 12 noon, the staff kindly kept our luggage in a safe place in the hotel. They also made some suggestions to spend our spare time i Singapore. In addition, they also arranged a taxi for us to go to the airport.We are happy with the hotel and the service we received.

On calling they told me that only deluxe-rooms are free. My mistake, I didn't do attention to the confirmation email, they confirmed 2 standard-rooms. We arrived at midnight and was very disappointed about the standard-rooms, very small, no windows, only air-con and no internet, the good thing about the rooms: they are clean. Next day I checked the deluxe-rooms, but finally for this price I don't agree and we changed the hotel. Paying only 40 SD more we've in very well four star hotel now. The perak hotel staff is very friendly, they offered deluxe-rooms and did no problems about our hotel change.
