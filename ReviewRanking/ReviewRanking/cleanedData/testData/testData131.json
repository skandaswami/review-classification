The location was quite good, 5 mins from the bottom end of Orchid Rd, 10 mins from Little India and Sun City.The room left alot to be desired, and was more like a double room in a hostel, to be honest. The lino on the floor was the first giveaway, along with the tiny reception. On arrival we were issued with breakfast vouchers and 1 room key. Our room was on the 11th floor, fairly quiet from street noise, however, we heard every step made in the corridor. The room size was crazy, not much larger than a double bed, no room for suitcases, the bed was one of the hardest I have ever tried to sleep in, aircon that didn't work, the room was freezing even when the aircon was turned off. At a minimum the room could have easily doubled in size. As it was I rang reception to complain, and was told we were already upgraded to a 'superior' room. I mentioned the pics on their website only to be told by the Manager these had been 'altered to look much bigger', HELLO! The only thing that was good was a nice hot shower. There was only room for 1 prerson in the bathroom at any one time. Breakfast was next door in the back of a nightclub, which was decorated in black and smelt like all good nightclubs do, was corn flakes, toast, cold scrambled eggs heated by old style bae-marie, tea and coffee.Our flight on the last day was at 830am, we were unable to have breakfast as it did not commence until 7am.

Overall, I give the hotel a B- I was actually a bit apprehensive, with the not so rosy reviews posted by some of the travellers who stayed at Hotel 81 Bencoolen. But surprisingly, my parents and I had a pretty okay time at the hotel. Of course, we knew that we were not getting first class service, unlike those who previously stayed there. Anyway, we were actually impressed with the location of the hotel since it is right in the middle of the city. Most of the fancy museums, schools and decent eateries cafes are within easy reach. Orchard Road is practically 10 to 15 minutes away by foot. Regarding the room were we slept (we stayed on the 9th floor), it was VERY basic and quite cramped, considering that we chose the Triple, which was good for three adults. However, it was still okay since the amenities were complete and thank god, in okay condition. The bathroom was alright, bigger than what we've expected. Needs a little maneuvering though if you want to take a bath since the shower is handheld.Overall, we had a decent stay, but housekeeping, UNFORTUNATELY, was a big letdown. I'm not really sure if they know how to clean as the beddings were ALWAYS haphazardly arranged, and the floors, not properly swept. Another thing, the walls are kinnda thin, so we sort of heard the footsteps and converstaions of those staying next door. But the noise did not bother us that much as we only went back late at night at we're just too tired and sleepy to complain.

The corridors are like little alleyways on a boat with people of the night in the corridors. Apparently, they rent out rooms by the hour too (!!!!). Definitely not a place for a small family with children. Decent accomodation can be got for the same rates or a few dollars more a few hundred metres away at the YMCA (Orchard road) or YWCA (Fort Canning Lodge), where we did move to for the rest of our otherwise enjoyable stay. I must admit that 81 Bencoolen is ideally located for tourists with accessibility to transport and plenty of good affordable shopping options; also close to Bugis Street and Orchard Road.

No roomboy to help, we have to drag our suitcases by ourselves, which was no problem on check in, but a big problem on checkout (we shopped a lot during our stay).The room was unbelievably cramped, we literally have to jump over suitcases just get to the other side of the room. Floor was dusty and to my surprise the pillowcases in our bed were made of some kind of disposable material which reminds me of a kleenex tissue.Bathroom was okay, a bit bigger than I expected since the room was very very small. Nice and clean.The thing is, I really don't recommend guests who bring children to come here. It could get nasty and scary at nights. You get to see hookers, drunken men and even transvestites..

It's close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT (one of the biggest MRT station in Singapore) -- about 5 mins walk, and located just in front of the Kopi Tiam foodcourt which opens 24 hours a-day, a 7/11 also is close by.
