The front desk (not restaurant) staff all spoke Eenglish very well. They were friendly and took the time to explain how to get around. The hotel is not located in the tourist attraction area, the closest being a 15 min walk to Plaza Catalunya. Take the time to visit some of the local restaurants and shops and see how people live their daily lives. I really like seeing life unfold in this residential (seemed upper middle class) neighborhood. There are a couple of college/universities close by. The only drawback is that the closest Metro station (Hospital Clinic) is a 10 min walk away. All the Bcn tourist attractions are really close to the metro and it was easy to figure out, just buy yourself a 10 pack which saves you a lot of money, multiple people can use it too at one time. We walked the streets at night and it was safe but I don't recommend it, you never know you might get mugged as we did in Sevilla.

Firstly we arrived in the hotel after much bother (Taxi man couldn't locate ithe hotel and over charged us) to find a small but welcoming atmosphere. We then received our key to what can only be described as the smallest double room i've ever seen. We had to walk sidewards around the bed to get to the wardrobe which was ridiculous when the bathroom is almost the same size as the room and the stripy decor on the wall didn't help. After requesting an upgrade, the receptionist moved us to the next floor to a double with two single beds, which resulted in a king sized bed free of charge, I suspect because to hotel seemed empty. This room was better almost double the size. One our first night we decided to stay local . . . big mistake after having a small but good meal in the hotel restaurant we went for a drink. We had two options a loud night club or a strip club (hotel bar wasn't open). It cost from 鈧? to 鈧?0 in a taxi to town which is reasonable. Would only recommended this hotel for over night stay.

It's only a couple of stops after here though that you arrive at Las Ramblas or Casa Batll贸 in fact any other tourist attractions are only a couple of Metro stops away.The staff were all very pleasant and helped me to brush up on my Spanish. The maids did a good service every day the room and bathroom were both kept very clean and tidy.We didn't have breakfast as we were on a room only basis but we did have our first evening meal in the hotel. The salad to start with was very nice and there was lots of it, then black rice for main course was also extremely nice and was only 鈧?0 for two people.There is one draw back though, the room service for a 4* hotel isn't the greatest. The menu clearly states it's available from 11.30 - 23.00. However when i called at 17.00 i was told they don't do room service till 20.00. Not too much of a problem but why have it advertised as being available when it's not.All in all if i was to go to Barcelona again, i would definitely stay in this hotel however it may not be my first choice.

On Sundays some of the entrances to the Hospital Clinic are closed but there are entrances nearby.The rooms are stylish and modern and the breakfast is fine (cooked as well as buffet). They closed the bar one night at about 10pm and the barman told us to use the minibar in our rooms, which was not overly expensive.The drawback is the underground although it is near line 5 (L5), the changes to the main underground arertuous - it means walking down long tunnels. The trade off is the hotel is good value but location is problematic if you want to do the tourist bits.The hotel gave me erroneous information on the fountains at Las Espanya. They are spectacular and are on show on Fridays and Saturdays only - we were told we could see them after 9pm and got there to discover it was a lot earlier. (The fountains seem to be very mysteriously scheduled, tourists guides are not plentiful).Watch out for pickpockets:it is serious problem in Barcelona. I was accosted twice once at the Sants Underground Station when I bought a tourist ticket (and the female ticket seller took an age to serve me . I then went through the barrier and a young man aged in his early 20s tried to touch my pockets. The second time was on Las Ramblas in the evening. If there is a group of you always had a tail end charlie to watch your backs, and when you get on the underground go to the middle of the train so you are less isolated. Do not do the obvious things such as display your camera etc.The Graudi bits are really worth a visit and the ordinary people of Barcelona are very helpful and frendly. You will be asked for money by unrelenting beggars, some hold babies in the Gothic area: Wise up to the dangers of Barcelona, but so long as you are sensible you should be ok.It is an interesting city - the main cathedral is really worth a visit, I had not realised that it is completely unfinished and the whole building is almost a building site .
