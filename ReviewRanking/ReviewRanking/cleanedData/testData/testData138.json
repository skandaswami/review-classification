I wore earplugs every night (front desk were more than happy to move us to a quieter room when we asked, but the new room was unfortunately no quieter, as it was next to the elevator). Light from the hallway shone brightly all night into the room.We had a few maintenance / hygiene issues in both rooms. The flooring was buckled by the bathroom door, and we kept tripping and hurting ourselves until we jammed toilet paper into the gap to remind us not to walk over that piece. The blanket on the chair smelt strongly of body odour and was visibly dirty. There was dried blood on the duvet inner (the cover was clean). There was no plug for the kitchenette sink, but front desk said they would lend us one if we wanted. In our first room the bath plug was broken and had masses of long hair around the base of it, which I very reluctantly had to clean off to try and fix it. Maintenance came to fix it the next day, they were very efficient.Great location, a few blocks from Union Square.We did not have an *awful* experience here, but it was too flawed to recommend to anyone.

Free internet if you have your own computer. Staff were a little young and surly, but so were we so it didn't bother us! Reception was manned 24 hours, felt secure. Maid service was weekly, but this was fine for us. I'm sure you could ask for more towels if you needed them. Only complaint was that after our room was serviced we had no toilet roll! Very strange. Hotel itself was in a good area, but walk down the same street and it's all a bit scary. San Francisco generally seems to be that way - one side of a street can be safe and the other side dangerous, weird.

I can honestly say I am very pleased that I did.Arriving straight from SFO international in a taxi was only 30 minutes at 4.15 p.m. so traffic was not heavy, and between myself and my two companions was only $50, with tip, very good. The entrance to the building feels very Nob Hill and the receptionist lovely. Check-in very smooth and then it was straight into functioning old elevators to my suite. I arrived at the third floor to a clean Hispanic-looking lobby and turned the key. Immediately I was impressed with the clean smell and the space for a single occupier or a couple. Exploring the delightful Art Deco tiled bathroom and small kitchenette leading onto a comfortable queen sized bed in a large living space, not to mention the wonderful walk-in closets, I felt quite at home. Super hot shower, large TV, and i-pod radio alarm clock, only added marks overall.Do not be put off by the negative comments because of the Tenderloin area, just turn left at the bottom of the street, Union Sq. 5 Minutes! I had no problems walking straight down Jones to Market St. if only to catch the tram out of town or to the Castro!Overall, an excellent location for walking around the city, shopping, dining and returning to lounge in comfort before doing it all again. Very secure building; no callers after 10p.m. I have been to SF quite a few times and have no hesitation in recommending Gaylord Suites for singles or couples. I am going back in July with friends to stay there again. If they keep up this standard, watch this space.Ian, Edinburgh.

The room was clean, staff were friendly and the price was good. However there were a few things I wished I had known before booking the hotel. It isn't a hotel really just a rented apartment, the maid service is once a week but if you can make do with the same towels and bed linen that long you shouldn't be too put off by this, the room and bathroom was nice and the bed was very comfy. The gaylord isn't in Nob Hill as advertised, it's further down, right on the edge of the tenderloin which isn't a very nice area. We had no problems but I wouldn't have felt safe on my own at night. The location, however is ideal for access to union square, all the shops and there is a BART station nearby (about a 10 minute walk).The building work is still going on as mentioned in other reviews but as early risers it didn't bother us once. It does, however, get quite noisy sometimes as early as 8am. Notices are put up well in advance if they need to turn the water off and it's usually between around 10 and 5 during the day when you would be out and about.The staff are than willing to help with any questions/problems you could have and sorted us out with a limo to the airport for a very reasonable price.

The building is extremely clean and comfortable, the location is perfect for events and business, and the staff are the most friendly and helpful people I have met during this visit to San Francisco. I could not imagine a better choice for lodgings in the area, and highly recommend The Gaylord for both business and pleasure travellers. My overall rating of this hotel is 10 out of 10.
