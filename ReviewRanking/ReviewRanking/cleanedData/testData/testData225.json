Traveling with my wife (we are both in our 50's), my son (20) and my Dad (age 72), I was nervous about what to expect from this little charmer. But it delivered! The rooms were small, but clean and modern, with plenty of closet space. The front desk staff was very helpful and pleasant in answering all our questions (in English). The buffet breakfast provided everything we needed - fruit, bread, cereal, juice, coffee, bacon, sausage, and outstanding scrambled eggs.The hotel is set back off the street, and we missed it the first time we walked by. But after finding the sign, we walked thru a short passageway to an open courtyard that leads to the front door. The Modigliani's location is superb. It is in Montparnasse, and 50 yards down to the end of the block you will discover that you are standing in front of the world famous bistros La Dome, La Coupole and La Rotonde. Go the other direction ( the street is only 2 blocks long) and there is another corner full of cafes and bistros. The street, Rue Delambre, also has bars, restaurants, and small shops. We had dinner across the street from the hotel one night at the Venice restaurant and it was reasonable and delicious. The Metro has stations at both ends of the street - one takes you to Cite and Notre Dame, the other takes you to the Eiffel Tower.We highly recommend the Villa Modigliani and will stay here again if we ever get back to Paris.

Each of these metros lead in to different areas of Paris, and also connect to the main interchange one station away which takes you to all of Paris. If you don't want to use the metro it is only a twenty five minute walk to the Seine in any direction, but we bought the three day unlimited travel tickets through expedia and used them all day long.This part of Montparnasse has restaurants, creperies and bars within one minute of the hotel, all friendly and open late. There are two supermarkets nearby for anything you may need, and a bank on the corner for the cash withdrawals you will inevitably need to make!We will return soon, as we genuinely cannot see us finding a better hotel without paying a premium for this.

The rooms are dingy, worn, tired, old--doesn't begin to describe it. Depressing and desperately in need of being torn down. The bathtub had deeply ingrained dirt and grime. And the courtyard doesn't have those flowers and accents that are so beautiful on the website, it has rubbish and ashtrays filled to the brim and empty cans. The breakfast is just awful, and the service is quite insulting: the waiters spend their time laughing and sneering AT the guests, and making snide remarks about them--if you speak French it's a revelation. The front desk service is no better: they claim they don't know the area and could not suggest a cafe or a way around. The transportation that they booked and that they use regularly for the airport was life threatening. Most of the other guests were on group tours.

The included breakfast was generous and with a wide selection of food, inc English breakfast.The area of Montparnasse is clean and friendly and there are many good places to eat. We particularly like the traditional French food at Parnasse 138 at 138 Rue du Montparnasse, which was 5 minutes walk from the hotel. There are some excellent seafood restaurants, with garcons standing outside preparing oysters, crabs, mussels etc for these huge platters of seafood. Not cheap, but you can get an excellent croquette of moules, plus frites and bread for around 20 Euros per head inc wine.Do visit Jardin du Luxembourg just 10 minutes walk away and take some baguettes, cheese etc, all obtainable from the boulangerie and the supermarche along the street from the hotel.

It's very close to the Metro in an area with many restaurants, especially if you love crepes. There's also a bustling outdoor market on Saturdays with a wide variety of foods (meat, fruit, baked goods) and knick knacks available. The rooms at Villa Modigliani are small, particularly the sleeping area, with little clearance around the bed, no sitting area or work space. The bathroom areas (separate toilet stall) were relatively clean and spacious. Wireless internet worked in the room, but was expensive by US standards (17 Euros from noon to noon). Safe was too small for a laptop. Bathroom amenities were a couple of small soaps so bring your own shampoo. Only one English language TV station (CNN International), which essentially shows an endless loop of the same stories over and over. No clock or radio in the room.Service was a bit lackluster. One morning when I slept in housekeeping arrived and made it clear that I had 10 minutes to vacate the room because they were coming in to clean. Coming back in the afternoon was apparently not an available option. If you're not planning to spend much time in your hotel room, and are looking for an inexpensive, clean place to stay in a quiet part of town with easy access to the Metro, then Villa Modigliani fits the bill.

I arrived the weekend of the Ireland-France rugby match, and was greeted warmly by a charming woman at the front desk. My room was a little more compact than I'm used to, but the bathroom was spacious and the shower both powerful and soothing. Especially welcome in killling the hangover I had acquired overnight (when drowning my sorrows in the wake of the Irish defeat in the rugby match at Stade de France).Though I was lucky enough to experience the atmosphere at the stadium, the Villa Modigliani was doing a lot to create a match day atmosphere with a wide-screen television and plenty of flags in the bar.Paris was basking in 25 degrees centigrade of Indian summer and the atmosphere on match weekend was superb. The woman at the front desk of the hotel recommended a fish restaurant called Le Dome, which is at the corner of Rue Delambre. Though the prices were on the high side, the choice of fish and shellfish was diverse and eclectic and the fish soup I consumed there was the best I have ever tasted. The fish is cooked simply and tastefully and the plates are not over-burdened with too much excess vegetable. The aim of Le Dome is to provide you with delicious-tasting fish and to release its natural flavour. Washed down with a glass of chablis, this was a meal to remember. The standard of unobtrusive service was way ahead of anything I have experienced in Dublin or London in recent years.As stated earlier, the Villa Modigliani is located in the Rue Delambre, a haven in the midst of Montparnasse. The street boasts a collection of different delicatessens, wine shops and patisseries. Try the Italian delicatessen, which will serve you a slice of hot pizza or mouth-watering pasta for immediate consumption. A lot of people simply congregate outside the place happily munching away at their pizzas or tasting their pasta dishes.In terms of value for money, the Villa Modigliani is a bargain at 150 Euro a night. Even though the bedroom was not large, I was very comfortable in this hotel and found it to be a very welcoming place.

And, I have recommended it to many friends and relatives, and they all have had the same satisfied experience as I have had. It is a great location - Montparnasse 14 arr., but on the border of the 5th/6th, just a few blocks from Le Jardin du Luxembourg. It is in the midst of a Parisian neighborhood with a farmers market on Wed and Sat's, grocery stores, wine and cheese shops, chocolate shops, clothing, books, health food, etc. The Tour Montparnasse is just a couple of blocks away with all its shopping center stores including Galeries Lafayette and the Gar Montparnasse. It is a hub for most buses and metro lines, as well as RER. It has many internet cafes, although the hotel does have high speed internet connectivity.It is also in the midst of a multitude of restaurants of all ethnic varieties and price ranges - from the fine dining at Le Dome to the neighborhood falafel shops and crepe stands. It is also in the middle of more movie theatres showing all types of films that you can find in downtown Chicago!This is the perfect Paris home base for any type of sightseeing, and a comfortable spot to relax after a day's walking around Paris. The hotel has programs that offer breakfast and/or a second meal as part of their very low room rates which I recommend. Even if you want to eat all your meals out, there will be a night or two where you'll appreciate not having to dress up to go out, and being able to go down to the dining room and have a deliciously prepared, gourmet meal with wine, then go back up to your room and rest your tired legs!

The reviews on this web page were generally favorable and I was able to book it via SNCF Voyages - a reliable on-line booking network in France [-]I have to say that Mrs. B and I were both very pleased. Although the hotel is in the 14th arrondisement, it is only 100 meters from the 6th which gives it all the advantages of being close to the Saint Germain and the Luxembourg Gardens but at 14th arr. prices. The rooms are small (but normal for Paris), comfortable and very functional with a sort of no-suprises Holiday-Inn or Hotel Ibis feel to them. I saw this positively as we have had our dose of squeeky Hausmanian floorboards and non-sound proof doors and walls. The bathrooms were clean and spaceous enough. This was pleasant after a long trip. Our room was very quiet and all seemed fitted with central air-conditioning. For eating out, there is a huge choice along the the rue Delambre and just around the corner along Boulevard Montparnasse. The hotel staff were all very efficient and helpful although the hotel has a business travel/bus tour feel to it and so can seem a little impersonal. The hotel has a large, locked bag room where luggage can be stored after check-out.About the only thing we did not like was breakfast. This is served in a windowless ballroom in the basement and tasted rubbery. Next time we will nip out to a caf茅 or brasserie along the Boulevard Montparnasse and eat breakfast there... and watch the world go by... We may well chose this hotel next time we are in Paris and I would be happy to recommend it to anyone. Although it caters for all sorts of clients, I would certainly chose it for a business trip if I wanted something low key, well priced and central.BTW - If you are into French cinema, keep your eyes open in this neighborhood as this is where many of the stars live.
