Just returned from 5 nights at the Tulip Inn Jul 29 08 - best decision staying here! Arrived from states 11 am room ready. Front desk pleasant, informative and most beautiful english I have heard spoken in a foreign country. Check in a breeze - best rates at tulip hotels website. While a little inconvenient time wise (waiting for buses into city central) well worth the inconvienence. A new hotel, it is exceptionally clean, modern, roomy, comfy and overall very nice place. Room made up beautifully every day. Nice to have full tub to soak in after a long day of sight seeing. Pricey mini fridge in room, electroncially set - tell front desk you want to use it for your own supplies so you will not be charged if you remove something - they are happy to do this. Albert Heijn food store two bus stops up towards city center. Two city pools and park out back of the hotel for your use, are a pleasant and refreshing plus! Railyard in back of hotel never an issue - very quite place. Short bus ride to train station(s) City Central and Sloterdijk (sp). From airport during the day, take Central Station train and get off at Sloterdijk Amsterdam, go out front and take bus 48 - it stops right in front of hotel and is only a short, 10 min. ride. Make sure you check bus schedule if you have early flight home - weekend buses run later and longer between buses - taxi fare from hotel to train station 10.50 euros. Nothing much around this hotel, restaurant pretty pricey, outdoor bar nice - very quite location - would not suggest for young partying crowd that would be crawling back to theirs rooms late at night - lol - it takes some naviagting to get to the bus in the evening and some time to get back to the hotel, but if you are a little more reserved or have kids with you, and dont mind waiting on a bus once in a while - this place is a comfortable, affordable stay!Free wi-fi in room - what a plus - you must buy a pay card to use the internet in the lobby - we brought our laptop,For those that need something negative - yes, the doors do shut loudly - they did vacuum the hallways a little earlier than we would have liked them to one morning - but they did respect our do not disturb signs, and the modern design of the bathroom sinks reminds me of stainless steel prison sinks - there,,,Had wonderful trip - make sure you take short train ride out to Haarlem and to the beach - Van Gogh Museum a must to really get an insight into his short life as a painter - very interesting. Enjoy the city parks, museums and a local brew at any of the outdoor cafes along the canals - found Amsterdam to be very laid back and to be very beautiful, comfortable and friendly!Red light district a cultural must-see - very surreal, very safe, actually interesting, just very strange! You see all kinds wandering the district including many families and many, many tours during the hours of 8 and 10pm - Randy Roys Red light tour, , while we had to hoof it after our guide Ki-ki, who is quick-quick - was quite fun and entertaining!Enjoy!

If the hotel is priced below other comparable hotels in the center, I definitely recommend this one.Here's the cool thing we did.... We rented bikes for the weekend to fit in like all the other Amsterdamers. It was amazing. I think everyone in Amsterdam rides a bike. We rode along the canals and went to dinner and the museums on our bikes. It was so romantic. Our bike ride each way to the hotel was....9 minutes. And it's safe with your own bike lane the whole way. We rented bikes in the center, but I think the hotel also rents bikes too through www.yellowbike.nl or ask the front desk.The hotel was new, clean and the beds were comfortable.

There is a bus stop just outside of the hotel (come out through the hotel doors and turn right..and its just down a little grass verge).The bus is the number 48 and comes every 15 minutes and is always on time!Reception were great, we arrived at 11am and you're not supposed to be able to check until 2pm but they found us a room straight away.The room was immaculate, quite spacious, lovely bathroom and the shower was fab and steaming hot. They have a tv with limited english channels.. but had bbc 1 and bbc 2 enough for background nois when getting ready to go out.Breakfast is continental and consists of various breads, rolls, croissants, a variety of cold meats and cheeses, scrambled egg, mushrooms and has browns and was really nice, enough to keep you going until lunch time.There is the restaurant which is a la carte. Do not make the mistake of eating in there, it is extremely expensive for what you get, you would be better going to the bar/cafe and having a burger which my partner highly recommended.Drinks in the cafe/bar are quite expensive but then Amsterdam in general is not that cheap, take plenty of euros with you.This was my first time in Amsterdam and was such a great experience that we're going back in April 08 and we will be staying at Tulip Inn Art again.. i would really recommend it to all.
